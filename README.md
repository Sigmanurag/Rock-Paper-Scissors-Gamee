# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Gamee

In this project, I have created a computer version of rock, paper, and scissors game. One can win, lose, or tie depending upon the random option choosen by computer and henceforth result will be displayed. Scores are tracked at the bottom.I have used HTML for structure, CSS for a modern look, and JavaScript to generate the computer's choice and compare the results. This game is an interactive way to test your luck and strategy against a computer opponent.
